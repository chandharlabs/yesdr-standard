# YESDR Governance

The YESDR Consortium operates under a structured governance model designed to
ensure transparency, technical integrity, and long-term sustainability of the
YESDR standard.

Governance responsibilities are clearly separated from technical development
activities carried out by Study Groups and Working Groups.
