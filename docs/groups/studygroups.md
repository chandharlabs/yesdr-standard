# YESDR Study Groups

Study Groups (SGs) are exploratory bodies established within the YESDR Consortium
to investigate emerging technologies, architectural concepts, and new technical
directions before formal standardization.

Study Groups enable structured research and feasibility analysis without creating
normative specifications.

---

## Purpose of Study Groups

Study Groups are responsible for:

- Investigating new technical areas and research topics
- Performing feasibility and gap analysis
- Evaluating architectural options and use cases
- Recommending whether new Working Groups or specifications should be created

---

## Scope of Work

Study Groups may:

- Produce technical or research reports
- Document use cases and system requirements
- Propose architectural frameworks
- Submit recommendations to the Technical Steering Committee or Steering Committee

Study Groups do **not**:

- Publish Technical Specifications (TS)
- Define mandatory protocol behavior
- Approve changes to existing specifications

## Lifecycle of a Study Group

1. **Proposal**  
   A Study Group proposal is submitted by members outlining scope, objectives,
   and duration.

2. **Approval**  
   The Steering Committee reviews and approves the creation of the Study Group.

3. **Operation**  
   The Study Group conducts investigations within its approved scope.

4. **Outcome**  
   The Study Group may:
   - Recommend creation of a new Working Group
   - Propose enhancements to existing specifications
   - Conclude its activities and be closed
