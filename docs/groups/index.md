# YesDR Groups

The YesDR Consortium organizes all technical activities through structured
groups. These groups provide a formal framework for research, specification
development, and coordination across different aspects of the YesDR standard.

Groups ensure that technical work is transparent, reviewable, and aligned with
the long-term objectives of the YesDR Consortium.

---

## Purpose of Groups

YesDR Groups exist to:

- Enable focused work on specific technical domains
- Maintain architectural consistency across the standard
- Support collaborative research and innovation
- Provide a structured process for specification development
- Ensure accountability and traceability of technical decisions

All technical contributions to the YesDR standard are conducted through
recognized groups under the Consortium’s governance framework.

## Types of Groups

The YesDR Consortium operates two primary types of technical groups:

### Study Groups (SG)

Study Groups are **exploratory bodies** established to investigate emerging
technologies, architectural concepts, and new research directions.

**Role of Study Groups:**
- Evaluate new technical areas and use cases
- Perform feasibility and gap analysis
- Propose architectural concepts and system models
- Recommend whether new specifications or Working Groups should be created

Study Groups do **not** produce normative Technical Specifications.

---

### Working Groups (WG)

Working Groups are **standardization bodies** responsible for developing and
maintaining **YesDR Technical Specifications (TS)**.

**Role of Working Groups:**
- Define protocol behavior, procedures, and interfaces
- Maintain and evolve existing specifications
- Review and integrate technical contributions
- Support validation, tooling, and reference implementations

All normative YesDR standards are produced by Working Groups.

---

## Governance and Oversight

- Study Groups and Working Groups operate under the oversight of the
  **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**.
- Final approval of specifications, group formation, and major technical
  decisions is granted by the **Steering Committee**.
- Each group follows established contribution, review, and publication policies.

This structure ensures technical integrity, consistency, and long-term
sustainability of the YesDR standard.

## Participation

Participation in YesDR Groups is open to eligible YesDR Consortium members.

Members may:
- Join Study Groups to explore new technical directions
- Participate in Working Groups to develop and maintain specifications
- Submit technical contributions and proposals
- Engage in reviews, discussions, and consensus processes

Details on how to join specific groups are provided on the corresponding pages:

- **Study Groups**
- **Working Groups**

## Relationship to Technical Specifications

This page provides an overview of the organizational structure for technical
activities. Normative technical requirements, procedures, and interfaces are
defined exclusively in the relevant **YesDR Technical Specifications (TS)**.
