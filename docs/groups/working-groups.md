# YESDR Working Groups

Working Groups (WGs) are responsible for the development, maintenance, and
evolution of **YESDR Technical Specifications (TS)**.

All normative technical work is conducted within Working Groups under the
oversight of the Technical Steering Committee.

---

## Purpose of Working Groups

Working Groups are responsible for:

- Defining protocol behavior, procedures, and interfaces
- Maintaining architectural consistency across the YESDR system
- Reviewing, approving, and integrating technical contributions
- Producing normative Technical Specifications and related documentation

---

## Scope of Work

Working Groups may:

- Draft and maintain Technical Specifications (TS)
- Process Change Requests (CR)
- Define message formats, procedures, and interfaces
- Support reference implementations and validation tools

Working Groups do **not**:

- Set consortium policy
- Make strategic or commercial decisions

---

## Working Group Structure

Each Working Group consists of:

- **Chair** — coordinates activities and reports to the TSC
- **Vice Chair (optional)**
- **Editors** — maintain specification documents
- **Contributors** — submit and review technical content

---
