<!-- ### SDR‑Native Cellular Architecture -->
YESDR is fundamentally built on Software‑Defined Radio (SDR), enabling complete programmability of the cellular protocol stack from the physical layer through the core network. All radio functions—including waveform generation, modulation, coding, scheduling, and protocol processing—are implemented in software rather than fixed hardware.

This architecture allows researchers, educators, and developers to design, modify, and evaluate cellular systems in real time using general‑purpose computing platforms and SDR hardware.

Key capabilities enabled by SDR in YESDR include:

- Full reconfigurability of PHY waveforms, channel coding, and signal processing pipelines  
- Rapid prototyping of RAN protocols, schedulers, and radio resource management algorithms  
- End‑to‑end experimentation across PHY, RAN, and Core Network using software implementations  
- Hardware‑agnostic deployment across multiple SDR platforms and RF front‑ends  
- Seamless integration of AI/ML for adaptive spectrum sensing, waveform selection, and protocol optimization  

By decoupling radio functionality from proprietary hardware, YESDR provides an open, extensible, and vendor‑neutral framework for cellular research. This SDR‑centric design enables reproducible experimentation, cross‑layer optimization, and the exploration of next‑generation wireless architectures beyond conventional 3GPP implementations.
