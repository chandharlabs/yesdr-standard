The YESDR architecture defines a modular, end‑to‑end cellular framework that spans the Physical Layer (PHY), Radio Access Network (RAN), and Core Network, with Software‑Defined Radio (SDR) as its foundational implementation model. All functional entities are realized in software, enabling full programmability, rapid experimentation, and hardware‑agnostic deployment.
